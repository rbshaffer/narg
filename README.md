# Introduction

Welcome! This is the course page for the University of Texas Network Analysis Reading Group (NARG). You can find the course materials, syllabus, and other useful links and information here. We'll update this repository as needed throughout the semester, but feel free to submit pull requests with your own resources or edits.

# Philosophy
This reading group is participant-organized and taught, and it'll succeed (or fail) based on participant input and effort. As a result, we're expecting everyone to come prepared, to participate, and to complete the readings for each week. **We're also expecting each participant to lead at least one week.** 

Details on duties for session leaders are below, and pairs are acceptable if workshop demand is sufficiently high. Some parts of the semester are busier than others, and if you can't make a meeting or two, it's not the end of the world. But, if you decide to participate, please view this reading group as a semester-long commitment!

# Format
Each meeting will be led by one participant, who will begin with a lightning talk (~5 minutes) on their topic. Next, we'll discuss the week's papers as a group, and identify sources of confusion, potential applications, and critiques. Finally, the week's leader will present an applied example based on the topic of discussion (e.g. example code, example data, analysis, etc). 

# Leader Duties
1. Select the week's applied paper and applied example.
  * Course organizers will give suggestions, but feel free to select your own.
  * Please send your materials to the organizers at least two days before the week's session.
2. Give a brief lightning talk on the week's topic.
  * Lightning talks should be about 5 minutes long, with about 3-5 slides.
  * The talk should introduce the topic, its significance, and the application that we'll be using for the week.
3. Walk the group through the week's applied example.
  * The application section should be about 10-15 minutes long, and should contain a live demonstration of code, a software environment, or other tool.
  * Applications need not be constructed using your own data, but they should be your own construction. So, no copying from the internet! It'll be more work, but we'll all learn a lot more this way.
  * Applications should be accompanied with documentation, so others can follow your work.

In general, leaders are not expected to be experts on their topic, but should be knowledgable about their week's material and the applied example they prepare. Prepare for your leadership week in the reading group with the same level of care that you'd prepare for a seminar course meeting, and you'll be in good shape.
  
# Participant Duties
1. Prepare
  * Show up each week.
  * Do the week's reading, and skim the week's applied example.
  * Try to look over a few of the supplementary resources.
2. Participate!
  * Speak up during the group meeting. We're all learning this material together, so if you're confused, others are likely confused as well.
  * If you know of any useful outside materials, suggest them to the organizers so we can add them to this repository.
  
# Logistics
Meetings once per week (times/dates TBD) for one hour. Based on demand and material, we may hold an optional half-hour mathematics section some weeks, in which more mathematically inclined participants can dive into the details of the week's concepts.
